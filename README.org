* Goals
- Other frontends other than the JS ons
- Accessible (moves can be made in algebraic notation)
- Chess clock
- Choose color

* Next Steps
- Design plan for error handling. If peers get disconnected, how is
  board state recovered?
- Does the site enforce rules? Can you put your own kind in check,
  e.g.?
- Does the chess board act more like a real chess board, or more like
  a computerized board? Can you pick pieces up off of the board and
  move them to the side, e.g.?
- Dark/light mode

* Stuff I've learned
- Accessing the correct `this`: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20279484/how-to-access-the-correct-this-inside-a-callback
- You can't use peerjs in nodejs
- You can't interact with local HTML/JS/CSS files the same way that
  you can when you're requesting the files from a server
